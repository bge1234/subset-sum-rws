Problem: Given a set of integers, is there a non-empty subset whose sum is zero? For example, given the set { -7, -3, -2, 8, 5}, the answer is yes because the subset { -3, -2, 5} sums to zero. It is OK to assume the set has no more than 16 elements.

To run, pass the set as an array to subsetExists() and console.log the result (e.g. `console.log(subsetExists([ -7, -3, -2, 8, 5]))`).

Output will be either "Yes" or "No" (the problem didn't ask to find the subset with the sum of zero, just to determine whether or not there is one).

To run the built-in tests, run `node lookForSubset.js`.
